# 🌴 Hono Bay Doodle

**Hono Bay Doodle** is an interactive p5.js web doodle inspired by Google Doodle and a winter trip to Waikiki, Honolulu. Set in an island city bay, the project blends playful visuals, music, and user-driven interactions to create a relaxing yet dynamic computer-generated art experience.

Rather than emphasizing static aesthetics, this doodle centers on **interactivity and unpredictability**—inviting users to shape the scene through clicks, buttons, keyboard input, and randomized events.



## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Island City Scene**
  A vibrant bay featuring ocean waves, a moving ship, clouds, rain, and city buildings inspired by Waikiki’s mix of nature and urban life.

* **Dynamic Weather System**

  * Click the ship to release smoke bubbles
  * Smoke bubbles affect cloud thickness
  * Thicker clouds trigger darker skies and heavier rain
  * A “Rainy” button generates randomized weather instantly

* **Living Ocean & Ship Motion**
  The ocean surface is generated using math-driven wave functions, with a ship that rides the waves naturally. Each passing ship appears in a randomly generated color.

* **City Lights & Music Interaction**

  * Buildings light up differently during day and night
  * A “Lights” button reshuffles illuminated windows
  * Clicking buildings randomly changes their colors
  * Lights can be synced visually with background music

* **Sound-Enhanced Experience**
  Optional background music (*“Uma” by J Boog, 2023*) enhances the island atmosphere, with full user control via Music / Pause toggle.

* **Randomness & Surprise**
  Many visual elements—colors, lighting, weather intensity—are intentionally unpredictable, making every interaction feel unique.



## 🎨 Artistic & Design Intent

Hono Bay Doodle is designed as a **playable digital art piece** rather than a passive illustration. Inspired by Honolulu’s rainy season and shifting island weather, the doodle encourages exploration, experimentation, and relaxed engagement—mirroring the spontaneous nature of island life.

The project emphasizes:

* User agency over visual outcomes
* Small actions leading to noticeable environmental changes
* A balance between calm ambience and playful surprise
